## Overview
The UCLA Encyclopedia of Egyptology is a steadily growing resource of high quality articles on ancient Egypt, written in jargon-free language. The UEE articles are written by the worldâ€™s leading Egyptologists and are all peer reviewed before being published. They provide in-depth information, relevant illustrations, and an overview of recent literature. As the UEE grows, articles will be updated with new research and information. When an article is updated, the older version will always remain available in the archive with the same stable URL. UEE articles can, therefore, be quoted as any other scholarly publication. 

This interactive application allows readers to discovery and learn about topics in Egyptology through a detailed map with an integrated timeline, illustrations and associated data, and through the texts themselves. Glossary terms, places, and time periods referenced in the articles are tagged so that readers can pull up definitions and descriptions as they read. 

### Background
The establishment and initial development of the UEE was made possible by two generous grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities (PA 51941-06, $325,000 and PW-50095-08, $350,000). Additional funding was secured in 2020 to make significant updates to the underlying architecture of the application and extend the features.
