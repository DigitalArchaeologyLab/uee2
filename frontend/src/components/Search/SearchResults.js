      "Emotions have been extensively studied across disciplines, but are best defined within specific cultural contexts. In ancient Egypt, they are presented both as visceral experiences that may be “contained” within or transmitted from the heart or stomach, and as socially constructed strands of personhood. Emotions manifest in gestures, postures, and, to a lesser extent, facial expressions in Egyptian art; the presence or absence of their markers in humans may be connected to decorum and status. Animals are used both in art and script to represent emotional states. Various expressive terms exist to describe emotions linguistically, many of them compounds involving the heart, and emotional states are described in diverse genres of texts throughout time, particularly in New Kingdom love poetry. This discussion presents an overview of how emotions have been identified and studied in ancient Egypt and suggests possible future avenues and domains for research.",

    body: "​    In all cultures, emotions are a key component of personhood ([Wendrich 2010](reference ID); [Meskell 2004](reference ID): 57-62; [te Velde 1990](reference ID)), whether or not they are viewed positively (see [Gosden 2004](reference ID)), or even as a separate strand to the self ([Assmann 1982](reference ID)). Broadly, they fall into the category of sensory experiences, like sight, smell, hearing, touch ([Fleischer and Norman 2016](reference ID): 1). Since they are deeply embedded socially ([Barbalet 2001](reference ID)), they have been viewed as motivating forces within society, either as tools wielded by a regime to maintain identity and control and as a means of social inclusion/exclusion (e.g., [Reddy 2001](reference ID)), or less polemically as forces binding together an “emotional community” in a variety of ways (e.g., [Rosenwein 2006](reference ID)). \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn the past there was a strong dichotomy between those who believed emotions to be a biological imperative and those who believed them to be social constructs (summary in [Leavitt 1996](reference ID)). Many approaches across disciplines now study emotion as both (e.g., [Kövecses and Palmer 1999](reference ID); [Tarlow 2000: 714](reference ID)), although some (e.g., [Gosden 2004](reference ID)) still distinguish “primary emotions” (happiness, sadness, fear) from “social emotions” (embarrassment, guilt, jealousy). Indeed, some have also argued strongly for the existence of a small number of basic emotions that are universal and not culturally determined (e.g., anger, happiness, surprise, disgust, sadness, fear: identified in [Ekman, Friesen, and Ellsworth 1972](reference ID), defended in [Ekman 1992](reference ID); compare [Plutchik and Kellerman 1980](reference ID)), although these are not accepted by all ([Ortony and Turner 1990](reference ID)). Recently there has been a suggestion that while happiness and sadness are clearly distinguished by human response, anger/disgust and fear/surprise form their own spectrums and thus the number of basic emotions is four ([Jack, Garrod, and Schyns 2014](reference ID)).\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nEmotions have been extensively studied in the domains of sociology, anthropology, philosophy and psychology, cognitive linguistics, etc., both in terms of how they manifest physically (e.g., Darwin’s study of emotions manifesting in physiognomy, first published in 1872) and how they are embedded cognitively and expressed linguistically (e.g., [Kövecses 2000](reference ID); [Lakoff 1987](reference ID); [Niemeier and Dirven 1997](reference ID)). Archaeology has also become increasingly interested in exploring emotional residues within cultures (seminal contributions in [Tarlow 2000](reference ID); [Kus 1992](reference ID)). Emotion has become a topic of considerable interest within classics ([Chaniotis 2012](reference ID); [Cairns and Fulkerson 2015](reference ID)), while Egyptology has taken a more piecemeal approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Definition*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDefining emotion, both broadly as a category and in terms of its individual members, is fraught with difficulty since definitions necessarily differ between cultures and over time ([Kus 1992](reference ID); [Reddy 2001](reference ID)). Many terms are used simultaneously both by laymen and specialist researchers, which has led to a blurred synonymity between some: emotion, sentiment, affect, feelings ([Munezero et al. 2014](reference ID)). Within the category, there are prototypes that approach being “emotional universals” (e.g., anger, fear). But along the category’s fuzzy edges, it is often a judgement call to decide what might be considered “emotional” or not. For example, in ancient Egypt, the emotional content in *mrwt* (love) seems unequivocal, but *Hst* (praise) presents a more difficult case. Both terms are closely tied together in texts (e.g., [Doxey 1998](reference ID): 28), and the definition of the self in biographies centers on the acquisition of *Hst* from the king, one’s peers and family, and one’s gods ([te Velde 1990](reference ID): 91). The line between personal qualities and emotions is also hard to draw. For the Egyptians, the quality of being “silent” (*gr*) or being “efficient” (*mnx*) may have had particular emotional resonance that is lacking in the English-speaking world. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nA working definition of emotions might be: aspects of experience that reflect a living entity’s inner life that may be expressed physically through gesture, posture, or facial expression, or verbally, and which are subject to considerable cultural glossing. For Egyptian conceptualizing of emotion, we might usefully look to the body’s center, which was believed to house the organs of thought and feeling. Terms for the heart and the belly (*HAtj*, *jb*, *r-jb*, *Xt*) show considerable overlap as both organs of the body and as vessels for emotion ([Frandsen 2001](reference ID): 159; [Nyord 2009](reference ID): 55-67; [te Velde 1990](reference ID): 89). In the context of the [Coffin Texts](reference ID), the *jb* exclusively serves as a metaphorical “container” for the emotions of love (*mrwt*) and anger (*Spt*), although the *HAtj* and the *Xt* may store fear, awe, and dread as forces generated by a fearsome entity ([Nyord 2009](reference ID): 75-78). The ancient Egyptians thus seem to have regarded emotions as visceral things, contained within the belly of the self and transmitted into the bellies/bodies of others. A person thought and felt with his heart, reinforcing the intertwining of those two actions ([te Velde 1990](reference ID): 93-94), and there is no evidence of a hard and fast distinction made between the physical and the mental aspects of these experiences ([Nyord 2009](reference ID): 113). This perhaps clarifies why many physical states (heat, cold, roughness, smoothness, etc.) are compounded with -*jb* to describe internal states ([Kholy 2003](reference ID); [Nyord 2009](reference ID): 86-113; [Toro Rueda 2003](reference ID): 63-90).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Emotions and Egyptology*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin Egyptology, individual emotions have been the object of study. Happiness and sadness have been compared in both art and language ([Beaux 2012](reference ID)). Anger as an Egyptianized concept has received considerable attention in the last few years ([Effland 2003](reference ID); [el-Magd 2012](reference ID); [Köhler 2011](reference ID), [2012](reference ID); [Tait 2009](reference ID)). Depictions of familial affection and grief have been studied from the [Amarna Period](reference ID) (fig. 1) when, exceptionally, emotions become part of the artistic canon ([Freed 1999](reference ID): 119-121; [Manniche 1997](reference ID): 36-38); grief itself (albeit stylized) is in evidence from the [Old Kingdom](reference ID) ([Beaux 2012](reference ID): 1567-1577) and bodily expressions of it are commonplace in [mourning scenes](reference ID) ([Werbrouck 1938](reference ID)). For the most part, emotions are not depicted on faces in Egyptian art; this is not unexpected since it has long been recognized that art strove to present the eternal, and not the ephemeral ([Simpson 1978](reference ID): 22). There are dramatic exceptions, notably in the reigns of [Senusret III](reference ID) and [Amenemhat III](reference ID), when (negative) emotional states appear to be represented in facial expressions (fig. 2): “bitterness, disillusionment, sorrow and solitude” ([Assmann 1996](reference ID): 76) seem to present themselves in royal portraiture (although Maya Müller [2009](reference ID) has argued that the only emotional quality that can be represented in the face is sadness, and the others are subjective readings by modern viewers) and are copied in the non-royal sphere. Thus, the emotions that are a feature of [Middle Kingdom](reference ID) literature suddenly find an echo in sculpture ([Maya Müller 2005](reference ID)). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is well established that Egyptian art represents its subjects in a unique way; Brunner-Traut’s ([1986](reference ID)) term “aspective” pervades the literature, although its meaning continues to be redefined (e.g., [Assmann 2005](reference ID): 28; [Verbovsek 2015](reference ID): 146-147). Nyord ([2013](reference ID): 144) suggests that the Egyptian artist was attempting to show “the completed object,” which accounts for parts or views of an object being shown that could not be seen together in reality,   while other  aspects  were  simply  not\r\n\r\n​      \r\n\r\n![Figure 1. An exceptional kiss from the Amarna Period between Akhenaten and daughter. Tenderness flows from the daughter’s hand, resting on her father’s arm, which in turn touches her shoulder, and the sculptor has, unusually, fused their lips together.](C:\\Users\\Maryan\\Dropbox\\UCLA\\Work UEE\\markup uee article\\8460_McDonald_Emotions\\8460_fig1_kiss.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Figure 1. An exceptional kiss from the Amarna Period between Akhenaten and daughter. Tenderness flows from the daughter’s hand, resting on her father’s arm, which in turn touches her shoulder, and the sculptor has, unusually, fused their lips together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshown. Emotions might be viewed as one of these latter aspects, if one is considering faces. Bodies might encode certain emotions—for example, raised arms might indicate happiness, and lowered arms, sadness ([Beaux 2012](reference ID))—but the possibilities here are restricted and unmirrored by facial expressions, which arguably only show emotion in mourning scenes (fig. 3). However, there were other methods for showing the “complete” personal experience, which included emotion. One method was the inclusion of animal elements in a scene, the animals seeming to act as exemplars of emotion: for example, distress represented by animals with open mouths ([Evans 2015](reference ID): 1665; [McDonald fc.](reference ID)), or fearsomeness embodied in the lion accompanying the king in New Kingdom battle scenes (although some would interpret the lion simply as a “pet,” e.g., [Gaballa 1976](reference ID): 122). Animals used in this way should be seen as distinct from those used to represent body parts in hieroglyphs, where they are exemplars of physical features (for the possible origins of this, see [Anselin 2001](reference ID)).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n​     \r\n\r\n![Figure 2. Obsidian head of Senusret III (Middle Kingdom), showing his typically hooded, heavily shadowed eyes and downturned mouth.](C:\\Users\\Maryan\\Dropbox\\UCLA\\Work UEE\\markup uee article\\8460_McDonald_Emotions\\8460_fig2_SenusretIII.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2.

The mourning women’s gestures convey their emotion, but their faces remain impassive. Compare, in the register below, the distressed cow protesting at the mutilation of her calf.](C:\\Users\\Maryan\\Dropbox\\UCLA\\Work UEE\\markup uee article\\8460_McDonald_Emotions\\8460_fig3_Hunefer.jpg)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFigure 3.  19th Dynasty vignette from the papyrus of Hunefer. The mourning women’s gestures convey their emotion, but their faces remain impassive. Compare, in the register below, the distressed cow protesting at the mutilation of her calf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we do not expect to see emotion reflected in the face, we might look for it in posture and gesture ([Dominicus 1994](reference ID); [Baines 2017](reference ID)); for example, in the embrace of couples in statue groups, we see either an arm around shoulders, or a hand on an arm (fig. 4; compare [P. Harris 500](reference ID), Group B: “. . . your arm rests on my arm, for my love has surrounded you”: [Fox 1985](reference ID): 22). Even if the activities of the minor figures in tomb reliefs and paintings contrast with the passivity of the tomb owner himself, the gestures of the former speak of practicality and not emotion ([Robins 2008](reference ID): 20). Exceptions to this rule can be found in the [Middle](reference ID) and especially [New Kingdom](reference ID)s (particularly among those of low status), but again the emotional content of a scene or interaction between persons derives from stance and pose rather than facial expression. Thus in the [tomb of Menna](reference ID) we see aggression between two servant girls, one of whom pulls the other’s hair, while the other girl grabs her attacker’s wrist. This is \r\n\r\n​     \r\n\r\n![Figure 4. 18th Dynasty statue of a man and his wife, each with an arm around the other. Their daughter is sheltered beneath.](C:\\Users\\Maryan\\Dropbox\\UCLA\\Work UEE\\markup uee article\\8460_McDonald_Emotions\\8460_fig4_couple.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4. 18th Dynasty statue of a man and his wife, each with an arm around the other. Their daughter is sheltered beneath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\na demonstrable example of both the representation of emotion and its reception by a visitor, who left a hieratic graffito above the scene, labeling it with the term “fighters” ([Hartwig 2013](reference ID): 33).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnemies constitute a special category in Egyptian art. It is rare to see emotion reflected in their faces (e.g., [Schneider 1997](reference ID): 102, no. 156B), but their bodies are often presented in states of chaos and disorder (fig. 5), which may be direct representations of how they were conceptualized (e.g., *btnw-jb*, *XAkw-jb*, *bStt-jb*: [Franke 2005](reference ID): 92). On [Tutankhamen](reference ID)’s Painted Box, the king, shown calmly in profile, shoots an arrow into a melee of falling and fallen enemies, many shown frontally, with soldiers from the Egyptian side dispatching them from within and making them bleed ([Schulz 2000](reference ID); [Tefnin 2003](reference ID): 34-35, 58-60). The caption beside the king describes him as making them into a *gbgb* (a fallen, weakened heap) ([Ward 1986](reference ID))—the determinative mirrors the essence of the action, where the physical pose echoes the internal state. The suffering of enemies seems to have contributed to Egyptian ideals of upholding [*maat*](reference ID), even if the infliction of suffering was not a prevalent theme in art and texts ([Marcus Müller 2009](reference ID): 133 and *passim*).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe torment encapsulated in bodily contortions as well as the development of negative epithets like *Xsj* (wretched) ([Beatty 2008](reference ID)) are both means of expressing “otherness,” since Egyptians (at least the elite) are rarely depicted or described in this state; this finds a close parallel in the art of the [Classic Maya](reference ID), where emotional displays had negative connotations and were reserved for the depiction of captives or others of low status, contrasting strongly with the “tight control” exercised by the elite ([Houston 2001](reference ID): 209-211, 215). One circumstance in [Maya](reference ID) art in which the elite might be shown in a state of emotional abandon is ritual drunkenness ([Houston 2001](reference ID): 211). Drinking, sometimes to excess, was part of the Egyptian artistic canon in [New Kingdom](reference ID) banquet scenes and occasionally we see the effects of this (e.g., a fragment of a banquet scene from an 18th Dynasty Theban tomb: [Mekhitarian 1980](reference ID): 87-88). A possible parallel  in the round is a drinking vessel in the \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n​     \r\n\r\n![Figure 5.  19th Dynasty scene from the Battle of Qadesh, showing the drowning of Hittite leaders. Their bodies are contorted, while tender gestures from smaller figures on the river banks invest their deaths with emotion.](C:\\Users\\Maryan\\Dropbox\\UCLA\\Work UEE\\markup uee article\\8460_McDonald_Emotions\\8460_fig5.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Figure 5.  19th Dynasty scene from the Battle of Qadesh, showing the drowning of Hittite leaders. Their bodies are contorted, while tender gestures from smaller figures on the river banks invest their deaths with emotion.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshape of a slightly off-balance scribe ([Russmann 2001](reference ID): 152). His expression is controlled, but his body betrays signs of drinking and eating to excess—perhaps the artist’s attempt to capture the hedonism of those excesses for magical purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMourning ([Werbrouck 1938](reference ID); [Volokhine 2008](reference ID)) is another special category in Egyptian art, mostly associated with women ([Meskell 2002](reference ID): 190). Again, its emotional aspect in art is represented through gesture, and not necessarily facial expression ([Beaux 2012](reference ID): 1569-1572). Mourners in painting and relief were shown with disheveled hair and clothing, with scratches or streaks of dust and/or tears on their cheeks, their bodies contorted to express their state ([Dominicus 1992](reference ID): 70-76; [Riggs 2013](reference ID)). In the round, a small group of statuettes depict male mourners, with their heads upon their knees, encapsulating a common expression from texts ([Feucht 1984](reference ID)). Texts further elucidate the psychological (and hence emotional) effects death had on the Egyptians ([Lloyd 1989](reference ID); [Shih 1997](reference ID)). A short-lived but striking development in the Ramesside Period was the depiction of stubble on the face of pharaohs to depict their grief for a deceased predecessor (fig. 6; [Czerkwiński 2014](reference ID); [Staehelin 1975](reference ID)).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n​     \r\n\r\n![Figure 6. Ostracon showing a king with stubble on his face as a sign of mourning.](C:\\Users\\Maryan\\Dropbox\\UCLA\\Work UEE\\markup uee article\\8460_McDonald_Emotions\\8460_fig6_stubble.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 6. Ostracon showing a king with stubble on his face as a sign of mourning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProceeding with caution, it might be fruitful to explore the ways in which Egyptian art sought, not to represent emotion, but to elicit it (cf. [Houston 2001](reference ID): 209). In the case of tomb art, designed to “seduce” visitors into remembering the tomb owner ([Angenot 2007](reference ID): 22), a general feeling of awe might have been the aim, and we see this reflected in visitors’ graffiti expressing exactly these feelings (e.g., “he found it as if heaven were within it”: [Ragazzoli 2013](reference ID): 284, n.92). On a deeper level, the positioning of such graffiti may evidence the writers’ desire to integrate themselves with what elicited reactions from them, concretizing the act of emotional reciprocity ([Ragazzoli 2013](reference ID): 274; [Den Doncker 2012](reference ID)). Engagement through humor seems to be the intended effect in other cases, expressed visually (e.g., the “antics” of craftsmen in a scene from [Ipuy’s tomb](reference ID) [fig. 7: [Houlihan 1996](reference ID): 50, fig. 46) or verbally (e.g., a weary servant complaining that roasting a large goose is taking forever: [Collier and Manley 2008](reference ID): 8). Whether the objective was simply to mock ([Vonk 2015](reference ID): 92) or to delight ([Baines 2015](reference ID): 11) is presently impossible to say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn his celebrated 11th Dynasty [stela Irtysen](reference ID) proclaims himself “a scribe and sculptor” (1.6). He describes his “accomplishments in pictorial representation, as well as some technical processes” ([Baines 2015](reference ID): 10), but since sculpture, relief, and painting include few details like “the cringing of a single captive, the glancing of one eye towards its fellow and the spreading fear on the face of a victim” (l. 10), it is possible he is describing effects created by words instead. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n​     \r\n\r\n![Figure 7.  19th Dynasty facsimile painting showing a comic scene in which clumsy workmen injure themselves and each other while sculpting a monument for well-being.](C:\\Users\\Maryan\\Dropbox\\UCLA\\Work UEE\\markup uee article\\8460_McDonald_Emotions\\8460_fig7_catafalk.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 7.  19th Dynasty facsimile painting showing a comic scene in which clumsy workmen injure themselves and each other while sculpting a monument for well-being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScribes were capable of creating particularly emotive texts not just through word choice, but through innovative orthography. Within the genre we call Letters (perhaps more appropriately “Appeals”) to the Dead ([Gardiner and Sethe 1928](reference ID); [Donnat Beauquier 2014](reference ID)), the written medium is manipulated to express the emotions of the senders: e.g., devotion in the unusually elaborate form of the *bAk* (servant) determinative in the Munich Vessel’s letter ([Buchberger 1991](reference ID)), and the dread in the choice of a unique Sethian determinative for *rswt* (nightmare) (P. Naga ed-Deir N3737: [McDonald 2002a](reference ID)). [Appeals to the Dead](reference ID) generally employ tactics of expression designed to elicit and manipulate the emotions of their deceased recipients. A striking example is found in the Cairo Letter on Linen ([Gardiner and Sethe 1928](reference ID): 1-3 and pl. I): the text begins with parallel paired columns, in which the appellants—a wife and a son—address the dead man citing their own relationship to him. The columns then unite and continue in what can be interpreted as four short horizontal lines before the text splits again into twin columns, each one addressing a different deity, before a final short horizontal line of text brings the two appeals together and the column ends. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe textual record overflows with acknowledgements and descriptions of the emotions that characterize and motivate human (and often animal) behavior. Approximately 90 words describing happiness are known in [Middle Egyptian](reference ID) texts ([H. Altenmüller 1975](reference ID): 330). One of the most common expressions, *Aw-jb*, literally “broadness of the heart,” is manifest in a bracelet charm of [Princess Khnumet](reference ID) ([H. Müller and Thiem 1999](reference ID): 105), the charm enabling the princess to wear the hieroglyphs for “happiness” around her wrist and therefore to possess the emotion. Similarly, the double-heart pendant worn by [Sennefer](reference ID) and some other [New Kingdom](reference ID) officials may have been a concretization of the king’s affection, worn amuletically ([Angenot 2007](reference ID): 28). Many studies of happiness have been conducted for the final stages of Egyptian history (e.g., [Vandorpe 2013](reference ID); [Verbovsek 2011](reference ID)) when sources engage with emotions more freely.\r\n\r\nWhile no in-depth studies of emotions as a sensory category in ancient Egypt exist (for a brief overview, see [B. Altenmüller 1975](reference ID)), many emotions have been discussed incidentally through overviews of figurative language (e.g., [Grapow 1920](reference ID), [1924](reference ID); [Brunner 1975](reference ID); [Goldwasser 1995](reference ID); compare [Jaques 2006](reference ID) for the expression of emotion in [Sumerian](reference ID) texts). Commonly, studies have isolated either groups of figurative expressions within specific contexts (e.g., those describing the might of the king in royal inscriptions: *Hsu* [2013](reference ID)), or have explored one particular emotion within a wider textual genre (e.g., expressions of fear in religious texts: [Bickel 1988](reference ID); [Cazemier 1977-1978](reference ID); [Eicke 2015](reference ID); although see [Zaniolo de Vázquez-Presedo 1958](reference ID) for a more general study of fear). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLove poetry concerns itself with encapsulating feelings in words and images that seek to concretize the abstract sensations of love and despair. Even the term mrwt does not tend to describe the abstract feeling of love within oneself, but rather a physical effect that emanates from a person, affecting another person; occasionally it is used metaphorically for the phallus ([Mathieu 1996](reference ID): 168-172). Animals in love poetry stand again as exemplars of particular emotional states: e.g., a crocodile representing feelings of threat or fear of rejection, and a mouse representing the opposite ([Deir el-Medina](reference ID) Vessel, stanza 4: [Mathieu 1996](reference ID): 98-99), a jackal representing lustiness (P. Harris 2, 2: [Mathieu 1996](reference ID): 57 and n.169). Very common are tropes that concretize abstract feelings, making them manifest as physical things or sensations: e.g., a series of descriptions on the Deir el-Medina Vessel ([Mathieu 1996](reference ID): 97) of love melding with the lover’s body like oil mixing with honey, like fine linen wrapping the body, like incense smoke in the nose. Further, each simile captures an aspect of love embedded in the body: a signet ring on the finger encapsulates its perfect fit, a mandrake in the hand anticipates the pleasure it will bring. All the images presented culminate in the idea that the two lovers will experience togetherness in the same way. Other senses are often evoked, particularly the senses of smell and taste through images of flowers and fruit. The longing for a loved one evident in love poetry is echoed in texts expressing the longing for particular cities ([Ragazzoli 2008](reference ID)), for the past ([Baines 2007](reference ID): 332-335), and for gods, particularly in the [New Kingdom](reference ID) ([Luiselli 2014](reference ID); [Sadek 1987](reference ID)). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEchoing the use of animals in Egyptian art to represent emotions that decorum proscribed in the elite human realm, examples of animal determinatives acting as emotional prototypes abound in script. A mother cow and suckling calf embody the concept of familial affection (*Ams*), just as they do in art; crocodile determinatives are used for a spectrum of terms ranging from the threat of fearsomeness to actual aggression ([McDonald 2002b](reference ID): 339-495), and various birds epitomize feelings of fearfulness. Most iconically, the trussed goose can be used as a determinative or logogram for the noun *snD* (fear) and its derivatives, perhaps because the exposed body shows “goosebumps” (e.g., [Héry and Enel 1993](reference ID): 145, fig. 178; [Terrace 1968](reference ID): pl. 13), but possibly also because it represents the endpoint of the frightening act of strangulation: numerous written (e.g., “I will seize him like a bird so that I may cast fear [*snD*] into him”: [*Urk*. I.](reference ID) 202.6-7) and visual renderings ([Akhenaten](reference ID) strangling a goose: [Houlihan 1996](reference ID): 137, fig. 96) of this act survive, and the sign is used as a determinative for the act of sacrificing birds as offerings as well as the birds themselves throughout history ([Ward 1981](reference ID); [Derchain-Urtel 1994](reference ID)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA fruitful approach to studying emotions in ancient Egypt might follow archaeology’s lead in searching for emotional resonance in things (e.g., [Gosden 2004](reference ID)). There have been steps in this direction (e.g., Meyer-Dietrich’s study [[2006](reference ID)] of Senebi’s coffin as an encapsulation of the self; Meskell’s acknowledgement [[2004](reference ID): 117-124] of the hatred invested in an execration figure as opposed to the devotion associated with a votive figure; Szpakowska’s innovative approach to [Middle Kingdom](reference ID) history [[2008](reference ID)], presented through the person of an imagined child growing up embedded within this period at the specific site of [Lahun](reference ID) and experiencing its physical and emotional landscape personally). The material cultural horizon, particularly studied alongside the realms of writing and art, doubtlessly has much to offer a researcher of emotions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n*Bibliographic Notes*\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe scholarly study of how emotions manifest and might be analyzed can be traced back to Darwin ([1872](reference ID); reprint [1998](reference ID)). Attempts to identify “primary” or “basic” emotions (e.g., [Ekman 1992](reference ID)) are often met with criticism (see [Ortony and Turner 1990](reference ID)), although certain “emotional universals” reappear in scholarly literature (e.g., anger and fear). There is today a general consensus that emotions should be seen as both biological and cognitive imperatives and social constructs (e.g., [Leavitt 1996](reference ID)), but different disciplines focus on distinct aspects, for example, Lakoff ([1987](reference ID)) applies a cognitive linguistic perspective to explore the ways in which many emotions are embedded within language (compare [Kövecses 2000](reference ID)), whereas Barbelet ([2001](reference ID)) takes a sociological approach. Within archaeology, seminal studies of emotions and their material manifestations are Kus ([1992](reference ID)) and Tarlow ([2000](reference ID)). In Egyptology, beyond brief overviews (e.g., [B. Altenmüller 1975](reference ID)) no extensive study of emotions or their manifestations exists to provide a comprehensive look at how we might identify and classify instances (for Classics, cf. [Chaniotis 2012](reference ID)). However, certain specific emotions have received attention: happiness and sadness in the work of Beaux ([2012](reference ID)), anger in Effland ([2003](reference ID)), Köhler ([2011](reference ID)), and Tait ([2009](reference ID)), fear in Bickel ([1988](reference ID)), and grief in Feucht ([1984](reference ID)) and Riggs ([2013](reference ID)). Individual discussions in Kipfer’s edited volume (e.g., [Baines 2017](reference ID)) explore the expression of emotion in art, principally in Egypt and the ancient Near East. Emotions are recognized as an important aspect of personhood in Egypt ([Wendrich 2010](reference ID)), and more specific studies tease out the implications of this for the centering of emotions in particular parts of the self ([el-Kholy 2003](reference ID); [Nyord 2009](reference ID)). Studying the use of animals in art and text offers particular insights into the ways emotions could be expressed without breaching decorum (e.g., [McDonald forthcoming](reference ID)). \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n*References*\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAltenmüller, Brigitte\r\n\r\n 1975   Gefühlsbewegungen.

      "Late Egyptian, the language of ancient Egypt during the New Kingdom and Third Intermediate Period, is attested in written form in a large array of literary and non-literary genres, mainly in the hieratic script on papyri and ostraca, but also in hieroglyphic monumental epigraphy. Late Egyptian is the first stage of the second major phase of Egyptian, according to the widely accepted division of the history of the language into Earlier and Later Egyptian. Typologically, Late Egyptian reflects major differences with respect to earlier stages of the language. Being more analytical in character, Late Egyptian thus displays a marked tendency to separate morphological from lexical information. It also tends to be more explicit in the articulation of sentences at the macro-syntactic level (Conjunctive and Sequential) and more time-oriented in its system of grammatical tenses than the aspect-oriented system of Classical Egyptian.",

      "Pottery represents one of the earliest complex technologies—that of changing a plastic material, clay, into an aplastic material, ceramic, more colloquially known as pottery. In order to produce pottery it is necessary to obtain clay, either from a water course or sometimes by mining, and to process it by adding “opening materials” (“temper”) to improve its working properties, or by removing materials such as calcite. Egyptologists recognize two broad types of clay, that containing silt from the Nile River and the calcareous marl clays obtained from the desert. The clay, or mixture of clay and other materials, is then shaped either by hand-forming, using the potter’s wheel, or by molding. The finished form is then dried. This is the last point at which the potter could rework the material by simply adding water to it. Once dry, the material is fired either in the open or in a kiln. Firing leads to the fusion of the clay platelets, which renders the material aplastic. It is the sherds of this aplastic material that are most commonly encountered in the archaeological record.",

    body: 'Pottery is usually the most common artifact on any post-Mesolithic site. In Egypt its abundance can fairly be described as overwhelming, and it generally requires substantial resources in order to be properly recorded by excavators. Pottery was the near-universal container of the ancient world and served those purposes for which we might now use plastics, metal, glass and, of course, modern ceramics. Its abundance in the archaeological record is not due merely to its wide use, but to its near indestructibility, and this is in turn a facet of its technology.\r\n\r\n## Raw Materials\r\n\r\n<figure class="embeddedImage__right" >\r\n  <img src="/media/images/fig1.jpg" id="ark:/21198/zz001dzmd4" width="300px"/>\r\n  <figcaption>Figure 1. Collecting Nile silt clay from the bank of an irrigation canal near Deir Mawas, Middle Egypt.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\nThe raw material for producing pottery is clay (Rice 1987). Egyptologists have distinguished two main types of clay for indigenous Egyptian ceramics: Nile silt and marl (Bourriau 1981; Nordström and Bourriau 1993: 149 - 187). As the name suggests, Nile silt clay comes from the Nile River. Strictly speaking it is a misnomer, since to a geologist "silt" and "clay" refer to two different particle-size fractions. For the Egyptologist it is simply a convenient way of distinguishing this riverine, alluvial clay—which is rich in iron and so fires to a red color in an oxidizing atmosphere—from the marl clays. Marl clays usually contain at least 10% calcium carbonate (lime), and in field tests can be distinguished using a 10% solution of hydrochloric acid, to which they react by effervescing. Marl clays normally fire to a cream or buff surface. This surface starts to form during the drying of the vessel, when the calcium carbonate begins to effloresce on the vessel’s surface, in the same manner as the glaze in effloresced <span class="taggedTerm" id="4">faience</span>.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas Nile clays can be obtained virtually anywhere along the course of the Nile (fig. 1) and are therefore widely available, the occurrence of marl clays is much more limited, being confined to a few main localities, notably around the <span class="taggedPlace" id="7">Qena</span> area of Upper Egypt (see Arnold 1981). In these localities the marl is quarried or mined as though it were a rock (fig. 2) and generally arrives at the workshop as solid blocks that must be broken up, soaked, and trampled in order to produce a workable clay (figs. 3 and 4); (Nicholson and Patterson 1985;1989). Veins of calcite frequently occur in marl deposits, and any pieces of calcite that are included in the clay mixture are carefully removed by those treading the clay, since to leave them in may lead to flaws in the vessel. This refining of the clay by picking out aplastic material may also be applied to Nile silt, which may contain undesirable pieces of shell, small stones, and other debris.\r\n\r\n## Clay Preparation\r\n\r\nThe amount of preparation given to the clays is, to some extent, dependent upon their final use. Coarse utilitarian wares may require relatively little cleaning.\r\n\r\nAs well as the cleaning of clays, it is frequently necessary to make additions to their mixture in order to enhance their working properties. These additions are usually referred to as “temper” or “filler” by archaeologists, although potters use the term “grog.” “Opening materials” might be a more suitable term. For example, some clays, or mixtures thereof, may be too sticky to handle well and so have another material such as sand added to them. This has the effect of reducing their plasticity somewhat, as well as “opening” the clayfabric so that air can penetrate it and help it to dry more evenly. Such open clay bodies may also fire more readily with simple technology, in that the more coarse fabric allows the escape of steam as the moisture is driven out of the clay during the firing process. A coarse body requires only simple kiln control; a finer one may require careful handling during the firing process if the vessel is not to become bloated and deformed as a result of the buildup of steam in the fabric. In addition to sand, it is possible to use crushed rock fragments, pieces of fired pottery, and plant fibers or hair. Dung can also be added, which brings with it plant material. Chopped straw or chaff may be used where an open-textured fabric is required, since it burns out during firing to leave voids. These voids help to prevent the propagation of large cracks, as well as allow the fabric to heat quickly, or to “sweat”—the evaporation thus enabling the vessel to keep any water stored within cool and fresh.\r\n\r\nPorous fabrics, be they silt or marl, are suitable for the storage of water. The amphora-like "Ballas jar,” still made from marl clay in the Qena/Ballas region of Upper Egypt, has been made in much the same form since Roman times (Nicholson and Patterson 1985). The porous clay allows the transport and short-term storage of water: the vessel “sweats” gently in the sun, the resulting evaporation helping to keep the water cool. The same principle is true of a whole range of present-day Nile silt-ware vessels, including the coarse straw-tempered gidr used in Middle Egypt, and the ubiquitous zir vessels for the longer-term storage of water, which are frequently found outside houses for the convenience of guests and travelers. Similar vessels seem to have served the same purpose in ancient times; zir emplacements are a common feature of the archaeological record.\r\n\r\nSome authors have argued for the levigation of ancient Egyptian clays and have cited tomb scenes as supporting this view. The levigation process involves the mixing of clay with large volumes of water (in a large container, such as a tank), followed by a period of settlement whereby the coarsest fraction of the clay settles to the bottom first, allowing the finer fraction to then be skimmed off so that a fine and uniform clay is produced. The tomb scene most frequently regarded as showing this process is in the tomb of Kenamun at Thebes, where a man is shown—apparently— wading in a tank (Holthoer 1977: 19). This would, in fact, stir up the clay again, defeating the object of levigation. The scene should rather be considered as showing the treading of clay, which helps to homogenize the mixture and drive out air.\r\n\r\n## Vessel Forming\r\n\r\nOnce prepared, the clay must be formed into a vessel. Although there are many methods by which this can be achieved, they are divided into two main groups: hand forming and wheel forming. Arnold and Bourriau (1993:15)have established a three-fold scheme for the development of pottery forming in Egypt, using “non-radial,” “free-radial,” and “centered-radial” techniques, according to how radial symmetry (that is, the walls being at an equal distance from the vertical axis of the vessel) is incorporated. Non-radial methods treat the vessel as though it were a piece of sculpture and essentially model it without reference to a particular vertical axis. In the free-radial method the pot might be constructed by coiling or rotating intermittently as the clay is drawn up to form the walls. Centered-radial techniques involve a rotating support with a fixed central axis—the potter’s wheel. The rotation of this device at speed allows the use of centrifugal force to help in the drawing up and shaping of the vessel.\r\n\r\nIn practice, techniques might be combined so that, for example, a vessel made by coiling is given a rim made on the wheel. However, historically there was an increasing tendency for vessels to be wheel made. There are numerous ways in which vessels may be shaped within each technique. Among the non-radial methods, Arnold and Bourriau (1993:16) define pinching and hollowing, paddle and anvil, shaping on a core or over a hump, and shaping in a mold. All of these methods were in use by the mid-18th Dynasty, but some were employed only for relatively specialized vessels. For example, bread molds were frequently made by pressing the clay over a core, known as a “patrix,” which gives the interior of the vessel its shape and smooth surface. The technology is simple and requires little skill. It is not unlikely that unskilled potters may have produced these bread molds in close proximity to bakeries, since that would have been more efficient than transporting large numbers of fired vessels. The paddle and anvil technique (fig. 5), in which a bat, or paddle, is used to beat the clay against an anvil (often no more than a round stone) in order to thin the clay and draw it up, enjoyed wide use from Predynastic times and was often used in association with coiling, which is a free-radial method.\r\n\r\nThe free-radial methods include slabbuilding, coiling—sometimes in association with a simple wheel—and turning on a turntable. This latter might be used with various non-radial methods. All were known by the Archaic Period /early Old Kingdom.\r\n\r\nArnold and Bourriau (1993:17) differentiate between types of wheel and whether they are rotated by hand or “kicked” by movement of the foot (fig. 6). All wheels, however, are capable of producing pottery using centrifugal force, as has been demonstrated in experiments by Powell (1995) (fig. 7 ). The first known wheels appear in the Old Kingdom (Dynasty 5 or 6), with the kickwheel perhaps appearing in the Late Period.\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed that the introduction of the potter’s wheel necessitated the use of a finer paste than that required by the handmaking techniques. However, this is not necessarily true. Many Egyptian potters of the present day use very coarse clays, with sharp inclusions, but work the clay very wet (Nicholson 1995: 286), with the wheel revolving relatively slowly, so that any sharp inclusions are easily pressed into the clay body by the pressure of the hands without causing undue abrasion.\r\n\r\n## Firing\r\n\r\nThere is a relationship between the fabric of a vessel, its firing technology, and its intended function. Generally speaking, fine clays require more careful firing, in a more controlled regime, than coarse ones. Fine clays are also generally more suitable for the application of painted decoration, or for service as prestigious table-wares. The same fine nature that makes them unsuitable for firings where the temperature rises quickly also makes them unsuitable as cooking vessels, as rapid heating leads to differential thermal expansion with resultant cracking of the vessel. Thus, for example, marl clays were often used in the New Kingdom for high quality table-wares and for producing amphorae for the storage of wine. The surfaces of these marl vessels are often carefully slipped and burnished—that is, compressed with a smooth stone or piece of hard leather so that they are shiny and less porous. The finely burnished surfaces of some marl clays, and indeed of some Nile silt clays as well, can be mistaken for glazing by those unfamiliar with Egyptian pottery, which is not glazed before the Roman Period. Coarse fabrics, frequently silts, can be fired in a relatively uncontrolled way, with a rapid rise in temperature. The porous nature of the final product renders it well suited for use as a cooking vessel (Woods 1986), since the numerous small cracks that developed during firing (as a result of the burning out of organic material sometimes added as temper) prevent the propagation of larger cracks (see Cardew 1952).\r\n\r\nFiring is the means by which the transformation from the plastic clay to the aplastic ceramic is achieved, and there are a variety of ways by which the process can be carried out. The simplest method is sometimes called “bonfire firing.” As the name suggests, the fuel is piled over and around the unfired vessels. Once the fuel is lit there may be almost no control over the firing, but experience allows suitably fired pots to be produced. However, there are numerous ethnographic examples of potters using this technique with great care, positioning vessels in particular parts of the fuel heap, and building elongated heaps such that the wind drives the heat back toward the rearmost pots, which require the longest firing but perhaps the slowest initial heating. In this way fine vessels might be produced. Little is known of the means by which the extremely fine black-topped red ware of the Naqada Period was produced, but it was surely the product of open firing. The makers of this ware were able to fire it sufficiently to produce a hard fabric, but not at so high a temperature that the burnished surface was degraded. They also managed to produce a vessel whose lower part was oxidized red, while the upper part was black as a result of reducing (oxygen deficient) conditions at the end of the firing. This may have been achieved by inverting the hot vessel in sand or vegetable matter at the end of the firing.\r\n\r\nA more usual way to control firing, however, is the kiln (fig. 8). Among the advantages of this structure over open firing is that the fuel can be separated from the vessels, thereby preventing their discoloration from contact with the fuel and avoiding localized areas of reduction/oxidation. The structure also protects vessels from the wind. Furthermore, if partially sunk into the ground, it can provide insulation, allowing for firing for longer periods or at higher temperatures without significant increases in fuel, as well as easier manipulation of the kiln atmosphere and more controlled cooling.\r\n\r\nAncient Egyptian kilns were invariably of the updraft type—that is, the fire was located beneath the stack of vessels, which were separated from it by a gridded floor or “chequer.” The hot gases (the draft) would pass up through the chequer and so heat the pots stacked above it. Vessels were frequently fired mouth-down so that each filled with hot gases, thereby slowing the passage of the heat through the kiln and increasing its effectiveness. As the stack of vessels heated up, the vessels themselves radiated heat. The heat trapped within the kiln helped to fire the vessels more effectively.\r\n\r\nAncient Egyptian kilns are depicted in a number of tombs, such as that of Bakt III at Beni Hassan (BH15), where they appear to have been open-topped, rather than having a sealed dome. The top would probably have been covered with a layer of broken pottery, as is the case with most contemporary Egyptian kilns . Such covering serves to provide some insulation, but equally importantly serves as a layer on which soot collects. At the end of the firing, after the kiln has cooled, the layer of blackened sherds is removed and the cleanly fired pots are removed from the kiln.\r\n\r\n<Lightbox />',
